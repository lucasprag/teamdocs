# TeamDocs by lucasprag.com

[TeamDocs](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lucasprag.teamdocs&ssr=false#overview) ensures that your centralized documentation is conveniently accessible from the Activity Bar, regardless of the specific project you are currently working on.

## Features

While working on my project, I can seamlessly access and review the team's documentation written in Markdown, eliminating the need to navigate away from my project or open a separate VSCode window or website.

All I need to do is to click on Team Docs in the Activity Bar to see my team's documentation.
